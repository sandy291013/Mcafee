--------------------------------------------------

Here are some troubleshooting tips for common issues users face while using McAfee products.

### Issue: McAfee Antivirus Isn’t Updating

### Issue: McAfee is Slowing Down My Computer

- **Solution**: McAfee is designed to protect your system without significantly slowing it down. However, if you're noticing a performance drop, try adjusting McAfee’s settings to balance protection and system performance. Running periodic scans and optimizing your system’s resources can also help.

### Issue: McAfee Won’t Activate

- **Solution**: Check if you've entered the correct activation code or login details. If you still can't activate, reach out to McAfee customer support for further assistance.

### Issue: McAfee Blocks Legitimate Websites

- **Solution**: McAfee might block legitimate websites if they are mistakenly flagged as threats. You can manually add these sites to McAfee's trusted list to prevent this from happening.

### Issue: Error During Installation

- **Solution**: This could be due to a conflict with pre-existing software, lack of system resources, or an outdated operating system. Ensure your computer meets McAfee’s system requirements and that you have no conflicting antivirus software.
